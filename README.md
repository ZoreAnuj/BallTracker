## Running Tests

# Problem 1

1] Make Sure that ball.mov and download.png files are present in your workspace. 

2] Run Problem1.py for running the python script. (I have shared alternative py script as well, but it takes ~15 mins for gattering centre coordinates)

3] Plot for centre coordinates and fitted line over download.png is shown.

4] Roots and x coordinate are printed.

# Problem 2.1

1] Make sure pc1.csv and pc2.csv file is present in the workspace. 

2] Run the Python script Problem2.1.py

3] Please make sure you have browser installed as the plotly will display the output (3D Interactive) on a new browser tab. 

4] Incase of any issue while viewing the plot please rerun the file.  

# Problem 2.2

1] Make sure pc1.csv and pc2.csv file is present in the workspace.

2] Run the Python script Problem2.2.py

3] Please make sure you have browser installed as the plotly will display the output (3D Interactive) on a new browser tab. 

4] Incase of any issue while viewing the plot please rerun the file.  

# Problem 2.3

1] Make sure pc1.csv and pc2.csv file is present in the workspace.

2] Run the Python script Problem2.3.py

3] Please make sure you have browser installed as the plotly will display the output (3D Interactive) on a new browser tab. 

4] Incase of any issue while viewing the plot please rerun the file. 

Please note: The iteration for RANSAC was set on high number of iterations, it make take around 25 mins for the results, the iteration can be reduced to lower the computational time.
